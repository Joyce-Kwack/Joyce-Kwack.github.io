    <h3>Here is my first project:</h3>
    <img src="images/bee.jpg" width="600">
	<p>In Bee Pollination, the user inputs how many flowers they want the bee to pollinate. The flowers then grow in response to the bee movements.</p>
    <h3>Here is my second project:</h3>
    <img src="images/wizard_maze.png" width="600">
	<p>In this game, the player is a wizard that is trying to reach their broom at the end of the maze. However, every 30 seconds, 
	<br>they are teleported to a different spot in the maze if they do not make it out in time. The player can use arrow keys to control the wizard.</p>
