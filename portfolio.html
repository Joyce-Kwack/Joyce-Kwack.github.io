    <h3>Here is my first project:</h3>
    <img src="images/bee.jpg" width="400">
	<p>In Bee Pollination, the user inputs how many flowers they want the bee to pollinate. The flowers then grow in response to the bee movements.</p>
	   
    <h3>Here is my second project:</h3>
    <img src="images/wizard_maze.png" width="380">
	<p>In this game, the player is a wizard that is trying to reach their broom at the end of the maze. However, every 30 seconds, 
	<br>they are teleported to a different spot in the maze if they do not make it out in time. The player can use arrow keys to control the wizard.</p>

    <h3>Here is the scratch project:</h3>
	    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1155790134/">
	    <img src="images/scratch.png" width="450"></a>
	    	<p>Players use their mouse pointers and space bars to swat at mosquitoes. Swatting a butterfly will decrease the score by 5 points.</p>

	    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zyjoKDK206Wx6lOJuwtAtxtpqEo9aRho7I64r4m1U2I/edit?usp=sharing">

	    	<p>We debugged the fish tank program so that it would work properly after a malware attack.</p>
	 
    <h3>Here is the rover project:</h3>
    <img src="images/inland-forest.jpg" width="400">
	<p>We chose the inland forest because the graphs seemed to match the description, especially the occasional thunderstorms. It was difficult to match the data to the type of sensor.</p>
